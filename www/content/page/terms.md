## Privacy Policy

### Summary

I have tried to make this reasonably readable, while still meeting legal requirements.

- This site uses Google Analytics, Dialogflow, and Google Cloud.
- We don't collect any personally identifiable information unless you send it in a message to the chat bot.
- Dialogflow **DOES** store messages you send to the chat bot for 30 days to facilitate training and machine learning of the chat bot.
- Dice Magic is a chat bot, so your communication with our service is through an intermediary like Slack or Google Assistant. You should familiarize yourself with that intermediary's policies

Your privacy is important to us. It is Dice Magic's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, http://dicemagic.io, and other services we own and operate.

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, and not your name or other identifying information.

We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. 

Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html)  and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.

### Google Cloud

This service is hosted on Google Cloud, and all traffic is through their network. You should review the  [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html) for more information.

### Dialogflow

Dice Magic uses Dialogflow for it's chat bot. Their [privacy policy is available here](https://dialogflow.com/terms-and-privacy).

Dialogflow stores all messages sent to it's chat bots for 30 days to facilitate training. Some of these messages are later integrated into the chat bot to improve its effectiveness.

### Collection

We don't ask for any personal information, however because this is the Internet, some is provided anyway, like IP addresses and unique identifiers from chat services.

We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
You should assume everything you say

### Sharing

We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.

### Third Party Dependencies

Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

### Postamble

You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.

Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.

This policy is effective as of 26 May 2018.
